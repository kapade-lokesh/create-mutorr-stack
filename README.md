 # create-mutorr-stack
  
A powerful CLI tool to scaffold a modern React project with Material-UI (MUI), Redux Toolkit, React Router DOM, and optional TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, powered by Vite. The name "mutorr" stands for Mu (Material-UI) and torr (Redux Toolkit and React Router DOM), representing a complete, feature-rich React development stack.
Features

Material-UI (MUI): Pre-configured UI components for rapid, beautiful interfaces.
Redux Toolkit: Simplified state management with a sample counter slice.
React Router DOM: Client-side routing with sample Home and About pages.
Vite: Lightning-fast development and optimized builds.
TypeScript (Optional): Type safety and improved developer experience.
Tailwind CSS (Optional): Utility-first CSS framework for flexible styling.
Structured Project Layout: Organized folders for components, pages, store, features, hooks, and utils.

Installation
Install the CLI globally to use it anywhere:
npm install -g @yourname/create-mutorr-stack

Alternatively, use npx to run it without installation:
npx @yourname/create-mutorr-stack@latest my-app

Replace @yourname with the actual npm scope (e.g., @lokes).
Usage

Create a new project:
Run the CLI command and provide a project name:
create-mutorr-stack my-app

Or with npx:
npx @yourname/create-mutorr-stack my-app


Answer prompts:

TypeScript: Choose whether to use TypeScript (y/n).
Tailwind CSS: Choose whether to include Tailwind CSS (y/n).


Navigate to the project:
cd my-app


Install dependencies (if not already done by the CLI):
npm install


Start the development server:
npm run start

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173.

Build for production:
npm run build

The optimized build will be in the dist folder.

Preview the production build:
npm run preview
